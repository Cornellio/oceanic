Oceanic Dashboard
==================

 A collection of graphs that display ocean and air temperatures for some of my favorite Scuba diving sites. Graphs are displayed using the [Dashing framework](http://dashing.io) using data from the NOAA Tides & Currents API, ([CO-OPS](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/products.html)).

Although the Dashing framework supplies a way to power the graphs with Ruby based jobs, I use Python instead.

While these scripts are designed in a modular way and could be adapted to other environments, they are not intended to be in final working state for broad use. **Use at your own risk.**

Directory Structure
-------------------

`oceanic/` - The root of the dashboard as generated by the Dashing  framework. This is served from a Ruby based web server.

`oceanic/jobs/` - The Python scripts here feed data to the dashboard.

`oceanic/dashboards/` - The oceanic.erb file describes the dashboard layout and contains tags that identify where the Python jobs send data to.

`oceanic/widgets/` - HTML, CSS and CoffeeScript files that control the display of widgets.
